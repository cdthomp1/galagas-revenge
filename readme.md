# Overview

This project, Galaga's Revenge, is a space shooter game designed to enhance my understanding of game development, event handling, and sprite management in Pygame. The game is inspired by classic arcade shooters but incorporates unique elements such as a dynamic wave system, an increasing difficulty curve, and the integration of joystick controls for an enhanced user experience.

In the game, players control a spaceship and must destroy incoming waves of enemy ships while avoiding their bullets. Players start with three lives and can earn extra lives by achieving score milestones. As the player progresses, enemy behavior evolves, and additional enemy types are introduced, increasing the challenge.

The purpose of this project is to deepen my knowledge of Python, Pygame, and game design principles by creating a playable, polished game with interactive features.
